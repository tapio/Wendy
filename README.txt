Wendy library
=============

0. Introduction
===============

Wendy is a C++ library intended to be useful for the production of small games.

The project website is here:

  http://www.elmindreda.org/wendy/

Wendy (for now) resides in a public GitHub repository:

  https://github.com/elmindreda/Wendy


1. License and copyright
========================

Wendy is copyright (c) 2004 Camilla Berglund <elmindreda@elmindreda.org>

Wendy is licensed under the zlib/libpng license.  See `COPYING.txt' for license
details.  The license is also included at the top of each source file.

Wendy comes bundled with a number of dependencies, each with its own license.
See the respective `libs/*/COPYING.txt' file for license details.


2. Building Wendy
=================

Wendy uses the CMake build system, which is available on most Unix-like
operating systems, and for which there are Windows binaries on their site:

  CMake (http://www.cmake.org/) for building Wendy and its dependencies

Wendy comes with internal versions of the following libraries:

  Bullet (http://bulletphysics.org/) for dynamics and collision
  GLEW (http://glew.sourceforge.net/) for managing OpenGL extensions
  GLFW (http://www.glfw.org/) for OpenGL context, input and window
  GLM (http://glm.g-truc.net/) for vector math and explicitly sized types
  libogg (http://www.xiph.org/ogg/) for reading Ogg files
  libpng (http://www.libpng.org/) for reading and writing PNG files
  libvorbis (http://xiph.org/vorbis/) for decoding Vorbis audio data
  PCRE (http://www.pcre.org/) for regular expression support
  pugixml (http://pugixml.org/) for reading and writing XML files
  Squirrel (http://squirrel-lang.org/) for embedded scripting
  zlib (http://zlib.net/) for compressed data streams

Wendy depends on the availability of OpenGL 2.1 and OpenAL 1.1.

On Debian GNU/Linux based systems, where GLFW also needs Xlib, the following
packages provide the necessary support:

  xorg-dev
  libopenal-dev
  libgl1-mesa-dev

On other Linux systems and other Unix-like systems, there will most likely be
similarly named packages available.

On Mac OS X, OpenGL and OpenAL is already built-in.

On Windows, OpenGL headers and link libraries should be provided by your
compiler.  For OpenAL, you will need to install the OpenAL SDK.


3. Using Wendy
==============

Wendy is documented using the Doxygen suite.  A suitable Doxyfile will be
generated by CMake in the docs/ subdirectory.

The renderers require OpenGL 2.1 and the following OpenGL extensions:

  GL_ARB_texture_rectangle
  GL_EXT_framebuffer_object

Additionally, the following OpenGL extensions are used where available:

  GL_ARB_texture_float
  GL_ARB_half_float_pixel
  GL_ARB_debug_output
  GL_EXT_framebuffer_sRGB
  GL_ARB_geometry_shader4
  GL_ARB_tessellation_shader
